## About Me  

I‚Äôm a person who made a tough decision to take care of future generations and make a peace with mother nature by changing his work career from a petroleum-oriented firm to become Computational Sciences master's student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin.

| [How to Simulate Water Molecules in Many-body Systems Using Efficient Algorithms](https://github.com/javak87/Molecular-Dynamics-Simulation-of-Water) | Python (NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries)     | Solving Newton's equations of motion does not immediately suggest activity at the cutting edge of research. The molecular dynamics algorithm in most common use today may even have been known to Newton. In strong constrast to the prepending quote,taken from an introductory text on molecular dynamics, one can argue that the simulation of large particle systems on multiple scales is non trivial and an ongoing endevour. To familiarize with the computational tasks, this project considers one of the most ubiquitous molecules, water. Despite its relative simple structure, the importance of water as solvent results in a whole zoo of available models.  |
